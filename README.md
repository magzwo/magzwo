## 🧐 About
I currently work in the banking industry, testing products that are used by millions of users every day. In my company I work on several projects at the same time, so organization is my strengths. I’m inquisitive, I have highly developed communication skills and I really like what I do. Precision, curiosity, perceptiveness and strong analytical skills are what distinguish me. I have worked in the e-commerce, insurance an television industries. I tested not only mobile applications, but also webapplications. I'm constantly developing- recently I took a SQL and DevTools course. In the future I'm planning to become an automation tester. 
I`m ready to take on new challenges!
