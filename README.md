Currently I am  working in the media industry and testing products that are used by millions of users every day. I perform manual tests and improve my teamwork skills. In my company I work in several projects at the same time, so organization and precision are my strengths. Constantly Im developing, recently I took a REST API Testing course in Postman. In the future I plan to become an automation tester. I`m ready to take on new challenges!
